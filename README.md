  ## Description
  <a name= 'description'></a>
  This project is a team profile generator. Running "node index.js" or "npm start" in the folders terminal will begin the terminal to ask you questions. The first question will ask the employee type. Using the arrow keys you will hover the employee type (which include; Manager, Engineer and Intern) and push enter to select it. The next question asks for the employee name. You will type in the name and push enter. Then it will ask the employees ID number, to which you would enter the number and push enter. The last general employee question asked is for the employees email address. Again, type it and push enter. The prompt will then ask employee specific questions. If the employee type was manager, it will ask for the office number. If the employee type was engineer, it will ask for their GitHub username. If the employee type was intern, it will ask which school the intern attends. Lastly, the prompt will ask if the team is complete. If it is not, hover over "No' using the arrow keys and push enter to select. If the team was not complete, you will run through the prompt again. However, when the team is complete, it will create an HTML.
